## About me
I am a chemist and have been interested in chemistry all my adult life. My specialty is a pharmaceutical chemist, and my work was also related to research in the field of chemistry. I have also been teaching chemistry since school, and since the beginning of 2020 this has been my main activity.

I think teaching chemistry needs some simple web tools that somehow haven't been created yet. I'm learning programming in order to create those tools that I can't find on the Internet for many years.

## Skills
* Programming languages
    + Visual Basic for Application (VBA)
    + HTML
* Operation systems
    + Windows
* Development tools
    + Visual Studio Code
    

## Sample code
